# Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge
Project 1 of PCML course, EPFL 2016.

## Summary

From data recorded in CERN Large Hadron Collider experiments, we will try to "find" Higgs boson particule. We dispose of a set of classified data on which we will test various supervised learning algorithms: Least Squart, Ridge Regression and Logistic Regression. 

We will analyze the provided data set in order to understand its features and to filter/aggregate/split them in a meaningful way.

With k-cross validation method, we will define which parameters are the best for each method and, afterward, which method is the best.

At the end, our predictions will be compared agains the other team ones in a [kaggle competition]{https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/epfml-project-1}.
